# Student-Project-Administration-System

Final year project @ Manchester Metropolitan University on BSc Computer Science (2020).

A web-based system for viewing, managing and assigning projects for the final year student project system to replace a current manual system used by the university.

Project Brief:
To develop a prototype student project administration system.

The number of student projects managed by the School of Computing, Mathematics and Digital Technology is increasing year-on-year. Next year we will have up to 750 project students (across a number of programmes incl. the DTS degree apprenticeship) that will require supervising. Currently, there are a number of manual processes that administer the supervision arrangement.

I am looking for a student who would like to build a web-based end-to-end student project administration system. It will include: 1. Storing staff members details, workload allocation; 2. Storing a list of project ideas; 3. Storing a list of students; 4. Storing templates of project documents e.g. marking feedback forms; 5. Implementing a supervisor allocation workflow process w/ underpinning logic; 6. Implementing a marking workflow process w/ underpinning logic; 7. An automated messaging service (via MMU email); 8. A report engine: student marks and feedback forms; 9. A report engine: MI e.g. average mark - by programme, supervisor etc.

The system will be a prototype to inform a decision whether to proceed w/ a full working model. It will not contain real world data.
